## Lessons Learned

Learned the basic foundation needed to start the presentation of a website and applied them on this website. I had to use very basic CSS which restricted me for using latest features used for websites these days and I overcame them by utilizing chatgpt by asking my problem instead of asking to change my code accordingly.
